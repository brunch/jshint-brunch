# jshint-brunch

Adds JSHint support to [brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Usage

Install the plugin via npm with `npm install --save-dev jshint-brunch`.

Or, do manual install:

* Add `"jshint-brunch": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app. Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your minor (y) brunch version.
* If you want to use git version of plugin, add
`"jshint-brunch": "git+ssh://git@github.com:brunch/jshint-brunch.git"`.

By default, only files in your `config.paths.app` are linted.

You can customize JSHint config by changing brunch config:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    jshint: {
      pattern: /^app[\\\/].*\.js$/,
      options: {
        bitwise: true,
        curly: true
      },
      globals: {
        jQuery: true
      },
      warnOnly: true
    }
  }
};
```

Every sub-option (`pattern`, `options`, `globals`, `warnOnly`) is optional.

If `warnOnly` is set to true then JSHint errors will output as console warnings.
This allows the build process to continue rather than exiting on any linter errors.

Alternatively if you prefer to use a `.jshintrc` file, remove all JSHint options
from the brunch config and place your `.jshintrc` file in the same location as
your brunch config.
